I am a PhD student at UC San Diego where I am studying the activity of LINE-1 retrotransposons in the mammalian brain.

I am passionate about improving undergraduate research education and 
addressing issues of diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM.

In my free time, I love to surf, swim, bike, hike and ski `r emo::ji('skier')`.
